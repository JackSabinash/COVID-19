Notes:
Data is loaded from 3 different csv files: confirmed.csv, recovered.csv, and deaths.csv sourced from:

https://data.humdata.org/dataset/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-cases

Future work section:
Add the ability to analyze data further with the graph, for example getting max and min values 
or the slope of the graph to anaylze the velocity at which the virus is spreading per country.
Add the ability to plot every country's data on the same graph to be able to analyze the difference 
in spread throughout the world's countrys.
